The following demos are from ETH and networking related:

demos/init_exit_ks:

	- Simple kernel space ReconOS self-test module, developed during the
	  libreconos kernel space port.

demos/protocol_graph:

	- ReconOS-based NoC with hardware functional blocks. This design is
	  used in order to partially offload the network stack (functional
	  blocks) from software to hardware and vice versa. Based on Richard
	  Huber's LANA/EmbedNet NoC design.

demos/voice:

	- Software-only version of the voice over Ethernet telephony
	  application for PF_LANA sockets. Developed and used in Daniel
	  Borkmann's Master thesis.
