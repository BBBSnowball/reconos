How to add a new plugin?
////////////////////////

Steps:

 * Copy the dummy plugin under linux/tools/sensord/plugins/dummy.c to a new
   file and change all the function prefixes to a useful name, e.g. what your
   plugin implements.
 * Adapt struct plugin_instance <name>_plugin plugin to your needs, e.g.
   scheduling interval, round robin block entries, or number of cells per
   block (= how many values you want to store in one time step)
 * For debugging and output, use printp() just like printf(). It's an internal
   function that puts things to syslog.
 * Fill the <name>_fetch() function with something useful. Access the
   self->cells array to store the collected values. The last index of this array
   is accessed through (self->cells_per_block-1), the first with 0 obviously.
 * Compile it, there's a Makefile in linux/tools/sensord/plugins/ folder. Then
   copy the plugin into /opt/sensord/plugins/ and start sensord, that's it.
