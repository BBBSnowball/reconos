////////////

configd:
		This tool implements a configuration daemon. It runs in user
		space on top of the protocol stack and performs automatic
		stack configurations (unlike fbctl). It also contains an
		inter-node stack protocol negotiation in order to setup and
		and re-negotiate protocol stacks during runtime.
		Usage, e.g.: configd config.txt

fbctl:
		This tool can configure the network stack manually. It can
		create and remove instances of non-vlink functional blocks,
		bind and unbind functional blocks and more. This is useful
		for debugging the stack, otherwise configd can be used that
		performs fbctl operations in the background.
		Usage, e.g.: fbctl add fb1 ch.ethz.csg.dummy
			     fbctl bind fb1 eth0
			     fbctl unbind fb1 eth0
			     fbctl rm fb1

fbprop:
		This tool prints a lana property in a human readable format.
		Usage, e.g.: fbprop 0 1 2

fbviz:
		This tool reads out /proc/net/lana/fblocks and creates a dot
		(graphviz) readable configuration. Thus, fbviz' output can be
		used to visualize functional block dependencies/bindings in the
		current protocol stack.
		Usage, e.g.: fbviz | dot -Tpng > test.png

readpvr:
		This tool reads out the Microblaze PVR bits and bit fields. It
		is needed for bootstrapping ReconOS after the init process in
		order to determine the number of FSL devices for setting up
		interrupts. Usage, e.g.: readpvr -V numfsl

sensord:
		This tool implements a sensor daemon. The directory structure
		/opt/sensord/plugins and /opt/sensord/database where the former
		must contain .so loadable plugin files that the sensord shall
		load during runtime. Errors or other information will be logged
		with syslog. sensord has an internal scheduler implemented as a
		timer delta queue. It is very lightweight and therefore suited
		for embedded devices.
		Usage, e.g.: sensord &

test:
		This directory contains scripts for setting up a wifi access
		point with hostapd and isc-dhcp-server.

timedb:
		Is a high performance time-series database. It replaces
		RRDTools as a more lightweight alternative with no library
		dependencies, so that it can also run in a busybox environment.
		Time series databases are not compatible with RRDTools, but can
		be transformed into such with additional scripting.

vlink:
		This tool must be used to setup functional blocks that reside in
		the device layer, such as functional blocks for Ethernet.
		Usage, e.g.: vlink ethernet hook eth0
			     vlink ethernet unhook eth0

netsniff-ng:
		This toolkit is used for network stack debugging and stress
		testing. It contains tools like netsniff-ng, trafgen, mausezahn,
		ifpps and others. To use it on a host machine, checkout the
		latest Git repository, e.g.:
			git clone git://github.com/gnumaniacs/netsniff-ng.git
		Usage, e.g.:
			netsniff-ng --in eth0 -b0 --out dump.pcap
			netsniff-ng --in dump.pcap --mmap --out eth0 -s -b 0
			netsniff-ng --in wlan0 --hex
			netsniff-ng --in dump.pcap --ascii
			trafgen --dev eth0 --conf pkt-conf.txf -b 0
			trafgen --dev wlan0 --conf pkt-conf.txf --num 1
			trafgen --dev eth0 --conf pkt-conf.txf --gap 1000
