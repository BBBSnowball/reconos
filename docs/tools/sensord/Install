How to install and run sensord?

 # mkdir -p /opt/sensord/
 # mkdir -p /opt/sensord/plugins
 # mkdir -p /opt/sensord/database
 # cd src/
 # make
 # cd plugins/
 # make

Copy 'src/sensord' into /usr/bin/ and all plugins from 'src/plugins/*.so' into
/opt/sensord/plugins/.

Then, run sensord with:

 # sensord &

All logging will be placed into /var/log/syslog. All plugin instances create
a timedb database that is placed under /opt/sensord/database/ and can be read
with timedb tools (https://github.com/gnumaniacs/timedb).
