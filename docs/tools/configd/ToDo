configd is just a _working_ proof of concept and it is _strongly_ encouraged to
re-implement it in a proper quality. Especially it can be nicely modularized so
that it will be easy to implement different strategies/algorithms!

Another feature that needs to be implemented is, that configd can multiplex
between multiple clients. This can be implemented by having a PID table within
configd while applications place their PID into IPC messages.
